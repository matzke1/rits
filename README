Rits is an issue tracking system that is integrated with the Git
revision control system.  Issues are stored as text files in the
repository for the project whose issues are tracked. Issues follow
particular revisions of the project across merges, cherry-picks,
rebases, etc.  The issue database consists of plain text files
so merge conflicts can be easily resolved.

Synopsis:
