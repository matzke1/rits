[description]
There is no easy way for end users to enter bugs.  The only way is for them
to clone the git repository, create a new bug, and get their bug merged back
into the central repo.  It would be much easier if we had a CGI-based system
that could be deployed on a server somewhere.

message         = The CGI script would operate on a clone of the central repo.  It would either =
push changes back to one of the review-candidate branches or make a pull =
request.  In either case, a reviewer would check that the issue looks good =
and change its state to "verified".
